<h1>Spess Hammer</h1>
<h2></h2>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul class="a">
	<li><b><p>1: You must be over the age of 18 years old to play.</b><br> 
	Why? 40k is filled with violent and sometimes overt bizarre sexual themes. See: Slaanesh, Dark Eldar. <br>Also a cover our asses rule</li></p>
  
	<li><b><p>2: No OOC in IC, or vice versa.</b><br>
	Do not use OOC channels to refer to the current round, or IC channels to refer to things unrelated to the game itself.</li></p>
    
	<li><b><p>2.1: Using netspeak acronyms in character MAY be punished.</b><br>
    It better be funny, or not aggrevating, otherwise someone may kick/gib you.</li></p>
    
    <li><b><p>3.You must adhere to some form of IC that can exist within the setting</b><br>
    What this means is your character must have some form of cohesiveness of their character. This also follows the rule of power seen in Rule 6.</li></p>
  
	<li><b><p>4: No Metagaming of any kind.</b><br>
	Do not use out of game knowledge of the <b>CURRENT</b> round ingame. </li></p>
  
	<li><b><p>5: Killing other humans or people of your faction/race without appropriate justification is against the rules.</b><br>
	Persay, the inquisitor is not a license for a murder spree, nor should a commissar field execute people willy nilly.
	<br>This also applies to xenos and such. </li></p>
    
    <li><b><p>5.1: If said human is a confirmed antagonist, resisting arrest violently, or assisting violent non-humans or antagonists, killing is justified</b>
	<br>Killing of non-humans is freely permissible, however it is discouraged unless said non-humans are openly hostile, either in action, words, or <b>intel reports.</b></li></p>
    
    <li><b><p>6. Rule of Power, the more power you spawn with the more you are expected to meet the IC standards that come with it.</b><br>
    Guardsmen come from all walks of life, standard Orks and other lower caste xenos do too.<br>Which means their RP standards/cohesion are quite low<br>
    But a lord general, commissar, inquisitor and such are molded from experience, in addition to being heavily indoctrinated.<br>
    Likewise, a warboss is the biggest and baddest. But has way more leeway with mayhem and comedy as such.<br>
    An Astartes of any type would also be quite indoctrinated.<br>
    <b> As Such you have higher expectations to meet their stereotypical baseline 	IC in being cohesive and a character that can exist within the setting of that type, otherwise what are you doing other than picking a job for equipment?</b></li></p>
    
	<li><b><p>7. Admins are accountable for their bans.</b><br>
    In the off-chance you remember this rule, and believe a admin is hiding a ban.
    Mention it, they must log all bans in a logging channel.<br>
    If it is not there you will be unbanned and a looky-loo will be had.</li></p>
    
    <li><b><p>8. Admins are also accountable for their actions.</b><br>
    Theres a fine line between admin-bus and round additions.<br>
    The server is quite episodic, as such they will set the narrative and change things. <br>Under no circumstances should a admin play a strong mob of their own creation, instead they should ask other admins or players to play it and give them a hint on how they should play the personalities they had in mind.</li></p>
    
    <li><b><p>8.1. Admins may not spawn incohesive things until a round has effectively ended in narrative for all sides.</b><br>
    What does this mean? Don't spawn a undercover goose if theres still life left in the player-driven narrative as its incohesive with whats going on, or may turn the storyline incohesive. <br>Likewise the introduction of random things without ANY thought put into them isn't allowed. Too much will ruin the soup, bitch.</li></p>
        
    <li><b><p>9. ERP is allowed with consent from both parties.</b><br>
    You better have a <b>VERY</b> justifiable reason to want to do this in a warzone too.
    The command staff may also punish you grievously for dereliction of duty.
    Likewise, in the off-chance you are off-duty in a non-combat zone(unlikely)
    You may pursue this type of thing, it also <b>MUST</b> be cohesive with your IC.<span class='fuck'> euggh...</span></li></p>
